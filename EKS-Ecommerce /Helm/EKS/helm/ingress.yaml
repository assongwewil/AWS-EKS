#ALB needs to be added as an addo 
#A load balancer is only able to direct toward one service, while K8s Ingress can direct toward multiple services in a cluster
# direct traffic twds multiple services 

#loabdalancer is not part of EKS 
# traffic LB *********> Ingress ***********> Multiple Servics

for n-tier ALB to the EC2 Instances 
for EKS ..... ALB to Ingress and Ingress to Multiple Services  and and each service to multiple Pods 

#   host file 
Each computer has a host file 
When we type a domain name on the browser, the OS checks the host file first to get the IP address/ if the IP is not found then it goes to your provider DNS server 
# if two containers are running in the same host, the can resolve or find each other via local host 
This means that their host file have the same local IP address 
if we exec inside container A and do a DNS lookup for containB DNS name, containerA runtime will go inside container A host file and see the same IP belonging 
to containerB DNS name 

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: robot-shop
  name: robot-shop
  annotations:

# remembner if we put this annotation configuration rules on top of this file it will apply to all the host 
We can have a seperate ingress file for secured domain and another for unsecured domain. and apply the annotations only to the secured doamins
we can have pulicIngressfile and private ingress file and the kind:Ingress name: value will be different for each 
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing    ****** this will add LB as an add - on 
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip

### for secrete we will also need to add this configuration 
we can have multiple yaml files for the ingress 

    
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic internet-facing    ****** this infor is take fron mgnix ingress doc to add secret 
    ngix.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
spec:
  rules:
    - host: # this does not have any host define/ this means it is definetly for all. i just added this host / we can use host to specify the host instead all host
    - http:       ******this is a list/ this is the first rule / Rule for each request/ domain.com is request 
        paths:
          - path: /      ####  everything after wil.com/ ie wil.com/A  and wil.com/b
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: web    #### this means all traffic or all request will come to this web service to be router to the port 
                port:
                  number: 8080
    - host: # host1  if we have multiple service running in our cluster, we can define rules for another service here 

    for headers we can use nginx Ingress controller doc how to setup headers here 


    - host:  domainName eg wil.com  # host2


  If we don't want EVERY ONE OR TO RESTRICT OUR FRONT END ACCESS, WE CAN ADD FE ACCESS AUTHENTICATION 
  FOR instance if we have an Admin console access 

  Look for NGINX INGRESS CONTROLLER AUTH 

  WE CAN USE HTPASSWD GENERATOR TOOL 
  WE NEED THE PASSWORD TO BE HASHED 

SAVE THE HASHED PASSORD IN A FILE CALLED AUTH 

WE CAN USE A COMMAND TO CREATE THE SECRETE ON THE CLUSTER, RETRIEVE THE YAML AND THEN USE IT 

kubectrl create secrete generic mycredentials --form-file auth ***** we path the auth file we just created

Add some configuration to the ingress file 

RUNNING ON THE CLOUD WE WILL NEED TO INSTALL THE INGRESS CONTROLLER
